# Lesson 2

These are the quizzed for lesson 2.  Those in the `baseline` folder are modeled after Sebastian's 
code.  Reason for this is every time you finish a quiz and advance to the next the starting point 
is Sebastian's code for the previous quiz.  Hence there is some merit in having that.  The `other`
folder is other implementations that solve similar problems.  In general there are only two 
problems at play (well, within the context of the various ways of considering the problem -- 
shortest path, A\* and dynamic programming) -- how long is the shortest path and what is 
the shortest path.

# Lesson 3

This is the lesson 3 project having to do with Gaussian naive Bayes classifiers.  Here is a nice link:

 * [Naive Bayes for machine learning](http://machinelearningmastery.com/naive-bayes-for-machine-learning/)

Originally this was a python exercise, which was trivial using SKLearn.  Then it turned into a C++
exercise in implementing Gaussian naive Bayes, much more interesting.



### Python

This is the naive Bayes classifier quiz for lesson 3 (part 16).  The two resources linked from the course are:

 * http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html#gaussian-naive-bayes

 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#Gaussian_naive_Bayes

I converted it to python 3/


### C++

There is a  C++ edition that does all the calculation manually.  There are some docs relevant to this as well.
